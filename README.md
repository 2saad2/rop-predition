I developed a predictive model to accurately forecast the rate of penetration (ROP) in Sonatrachâ€™s drilling operations, a key metric for drilling efficiency and cost reduction. My work involved data cleaning, selecting critical features, and training an Adaboost model with Random Forest as the base estimator. Using real drilling data from Sonatrach wells, the model achieved strong results in ROP prediction.
